REQUIREMENTS
------------

   * Atomic_ops library is needed for Microbench. It provides
     implementations for atomic memory update operations on a number of
     architectures. It can be downloaded online: 
     http://hplabs.hp.com/research/linux/atomic_ops/

   * SPARC needs the atomic_ops patch to run Microbench. This patch 
     can be downloaded here http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?
     func=detail&aid=2805831&group_id=144171&atid=757775

   * STMs. Microbench aimed at testing an STM. Some are available online:
     - TinySTM   http://tmware.org/tinystm
     - SwissTM   http://lpd.epfl.ch/site/research/tmeval
     - E-STM     http://lpd.epfl.ch/gramoli/php/estm

   * To use red-black tree, download the rbtree.c and rbtree.h files of 
     the STAMP release and place them into [microbench]/rbtree directory

INSTALL
-------  

   1. Download an STM (e.g., http://lpd.epfl.ch/gramoli/php/estm) 
      Compile the STM
 
   2. Set ./common/Makefile.common
      - libatomic_ops directory (LIBAO)
      - STM directories (e.g., ESTMDIR)

   3. Compile with E-STM using 
        make estm

   NB Alternatively, you can directly use the lock-based versions 
      (without using any STM) by compiling the mutex or spinlock 
      versions as follows:
        make lock 
        make spinlock


RUN
---

   1. Executables for double-ended queue, hash table, linked list, 
      red-black tree, skip list, lock-based linked list, lock-based
      hashtable, lock-based skip list:
      ./deque/lf-dq
      ./hashtable/lf-ht
      ./linkedlist/lf-ll
      ./rbtree/lf-rt 
      ./skiplist/lf-sl
      ./hashtable/lb-ht
      ./linkedlist/lb-ll
      ./skiplist/lb-sl
   2. Use parameter "--help" for the full list of parameters
